A far pointer is a concept used in some computer architectures, including x86, to represent a memory address that includes both a segment and an offset. This concept is particularly relevant in segmented memory models, such as the one used in x86 real mode.

In x86 real mode:

- **Segment:** A 16-bit value representing a segment of memory. The actual physical address is calculated by multiplying the segment value by 16 (shifting it left by 4 bits).

- **Offset:** A 16-bit value representing the distance from the beginning of the segment to a specific memory location.

A far pointer combines these two values to point to a specific memory address in the form [Segment:Offset].

Here's an example in assembly language:

```assembly
segment_value dw 0x1000    ; Example segment value
offset_value  dw 0x0100    ; Example offset value

far_pointer   dd 0         ; Far pointer (combination of segment and offset)

; Set up the far pointer
mov ax, segment_value
shl ax, 4                  ; Shift left by 4 bits to multiply by 16
mov [far_pointer], ax      ; Set the segment part of the far pointer
mov ax, offset_value
mov [far_pointer + 2], ax  ; Set the offset part of the far pointer
```

In this example, the far pointer `[Segment:Offset]` is created by combining the segment and offset values. The segment value is stored at the lower memory address, and the offset value is stored at the higher memory address. The resulting far pointer can be used to reference a specific location in memory using the segment and offset.

It's worth noting that the concept of far pointers is specific to certain memory models, such as the segmented memory model used in x86 real mode. In protected mode or long mode, x86 architectures use flat memory models, and far pointers are not as commonly used.
