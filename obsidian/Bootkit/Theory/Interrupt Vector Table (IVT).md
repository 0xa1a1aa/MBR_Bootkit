An Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) is a data structure in computer architecture that maps interrupt numbers to the addresses of their corresponding interrupt service routines (ISRs). It is commonly used in systems with interrupt-driven I/O to handle hardware and software interrupts.

In x86 architecture, such as the Intel 8086/8088 and their successors, the IVT is a crucial part of the system. In the context of x86:

- **Size and Structure:** The IVT consists of 256 entries, each 4 bytes in size. Each entry contains a 16-bit segment and a 16-bit offset, forming a far pointer. The interrupt vector number (interrupt number) serves as an index into the table.

- **Interrupt Numbering:** Interrupt numbers typically range from 0 to 255. Hardware interrupts, such as those generated by devices, have fixed numbers associated with them. Software interrupts, often triggered by instructions like `INT` in assembly language, use custom interrupt numbers.

- **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):** An ISR is a piece of code responsible for handling a specific interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, the processor looks up the corresponding entry in the IVT to find the address of the ISR. It then transfers control to that address.

Here's a simplified example of the structure:

```plaintext
IVT Entry 0:   [SEG_0  OFFSET_0]  ; ISR for interrupt 0
IVT Entry 1:   [SEG_1  OFFSET_1]  ; ISR for interrupt 1
...
IVT Entry 20:  [SEG_20 OFFSET_20] ; ISR for interrupt 20
...
IVT Entry 255: [SEG_255 OFFSET_255] ; ISR for interrupt 255
```

During system startup or initialization, the operating system or BIOS sets up the IVT with the appropriate addresses of ISRs for different interrupts. When an interrupt occurs, the processor looks up the IVT to find the ISR and transfers control to that routine.

The structure and usage of the IVT can vary across architectures, but the concept of mapping interrupts to their corresponding routines is common in many computer systems.
